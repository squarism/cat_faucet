== Smarthome

Rails3 webapp that monitors sensors around the home.  Right now, just a sink for my cat.  :)

== Layout
Arduino folder for arduino code to be uploaded onto an arduino

cat_faucet_bridge.rb that collects arduino data and loads it to a rails JSON route, bridging serial and the rails app.

Normal rails layout after that.
